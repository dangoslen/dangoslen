# 👋 Hi, I’m Dan

I'm a husband, dad, software engineer, and outdoor enthusiast. 

I'm also helping software devs build their teams. I have a 📰 [newsletter](https://dangoslen.me/newsletter/), a ✍️ [blog](https://dangoslen.me/blog), and a few projects (👇) to help teams do just that.

* Changelog management ([Changelog Enforcer](https://github.com/dangoslen/changelog-enforcer), [Dependabot Changelog Helper](https://github.com/dangoslen/dependabot-changelog-helper))
* [Pull request template](https://dangoslen.me/pull-request-template/#pr-template)
* An upcoming 📘 [book on code reviews](https://dangoslen.me/book)
