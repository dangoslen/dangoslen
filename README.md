# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dan

I help engineering teams become the best they can be. I have a [newsletter](https://dangoslen.me/newsletter/), a [blog](https://dangoslen.me/blog), and a few projects (ðŸ‘‡) to help teams do just that.

* Changelog management ([Changelog Enforcer](https://github.com/dangoslen/changelog-enforcer), [Dependabot Changelog Helper](https://github.com/dangoslen/dependabot-changelog-helper))
* [Pull request template](https://dangoslen.me/pull-request-template/#pr-template)
* An upcoming [book on code reviews](https://dangoslen.me/book)
